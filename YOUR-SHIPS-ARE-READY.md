### Want to add more ships?

1. **Download** a new ship model (.glb format)
2. **Place** it in `public/models/`
3. **Update** `app/ships/page.tsx`:

```tsx
const shipModels = [
  // ... existing ships
  {
    id: 'new-ship',
    name: 'Your New Ship',
    url: '/models/new-ship.glb',
    description: 'Description here',
    environment: 'sunset' as const,
  },
];
```

### Want to customize lighting?

Edit any page and adjust these values:
```tsx
<ModelViewer
  ambientIntensity={0.5}      // Overall brightness
  keyLightIntensity={1.5}     // Main light

  rimLightIntensity={1}       // Edge highlights
  environmentPreset="sunset"  // or "city", "forest", etc.
/>
```

### Want different camera angles?

```tsx
<ModelViewer
  defaultRotationX={0}        // Tilt up/down
  defaultRotationY={45}       // Rotate left/right
  defaultZoom={2}             // Distance from ship
